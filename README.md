## Project Description 

I built this application as part of my Bootcamp assignment. This was my first time using React and I really loved it. It does really well with my personality of being highly organized. The components really did the trick. Using JS before, I would get frustrated at times, feeling that I couldn't undrestand what I had wrote. With React the components really help with undrestanig and being able to read the code better.  

## Criteria

I was asked to Build a dictionary app with a search engine with API integration and host it on Netlify. Since my Bootcamp is Front-End focused, I did not need to store any data or use any Back-End tools. 
I have used React, HTML, CSS, API/AJAX, and Bootstrap to create this dazzling app!
